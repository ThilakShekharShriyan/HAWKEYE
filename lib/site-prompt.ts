You receive a short time-ordered episode of frames showing a ${site}, plus the CANDIDATES: sites already registered, each with reference photos and known contents.
A site is a place where things are kept: a fridge, a table, a desk, a shelf, a counter, a cupboard. It can also be any place someone asked to remember as a landmark: a doorway, a corner of a room, a whiteboard, a sofa. For a landmark, the inventory is the movable things at it (a bag on the sofa, a jacket on the hook), not the walls, floor or furniture, and never people.

Report, in this order:
- "observed": the site in the EPISODE frames: what it is, colour/finish/material, shape or door layout, distinctive marks, what stands next to or behind it.
- "candidatesObserved": the same description for each candidate's reference photos, e.g. {"A": "..."}. Describe what the reference photos actually show, not the episode.
- "identity": the letter of the candidate that is the SAME PHYSICAL site as in the episode, "new" if it is a different one (or there are no candidates), or "unsure".
  Compare "observed" with "candidatesObserved". A different kind of site, colour/finish or layout means a different site. Different viewing angles, an open door, a person or hand in front, motion blur, or different things lying on it do not: contents change, the site stays.
  Two sites of the same kind are still different sites. Another table, even in the same room, is "new" unless its reference photo and distinctive look are this same table. Do not pick a candidate only because both are tables.
- "identityConfidence": 0..1 confidence in "identity".
- "identityReason": a few words explaining the identity decision.
- "container": the kind of site, lowercase ("${site}" unless it is clearly something else, e.g. "freezer").
- "referenceFrame": 1-based index of the frame that best shows the whole site, or null.
- "contentsVisible": true if the things kept in or on the site are visible in any frame (door open for a fridge or cupboard; the surface in view for a table or shelf).
- "inventoryBefore": things in or on the site in the EARLIEST frame(s) where its contents are visible, or null if never visible early.
- "inventoryAfter": things in or on the site in the LATEST frame(s) where its contents are visible, or null if never visible.
  Each inventory is a list of {"name","count"}. Count identical things one by one: three cans are {"name":"coke can","count":3}, never three entries and never count 1.
  Give an inventory whenever things kept there are clearly visible, listing everything you can see; null only when no contents are visible at all.
- "coverage": "full" if the latest frames show essentially all of where things are kept (the whole table top, every shelf), "partial" if part of it is out of frame or hidden, null if no contents are visible.
  For a table, desk or counter list only the things resting on it, not the furniture, the floor, people or hands. Things on other furniture, on shelves or counters behind it, or elsewhere in the room are not at this site: leave them out, even when they are the clearest things in the frame.
  A site is the same physical object, not the same kind of object: another table or chair in the same room is a different site ("new"). A candidate that is clearly in view counts even when it fills only part of the frame (a chair across the room is still that chair); a view in which it cannot be made out at all is "unsure". A thing held in a hand above the site is not on it.
  Inventories come from the pixels only. Go shelf by shelf, or left to right across a surface, and name and count what is actually there. A candidate's known contents are what was seen on an earlier visit and may have changed since: they are a spelling guide, never a checklist. Do not list a known item you cannot see now, do not copy an old count, and do list new items.
- "missingKnown": known items of the identified candidate that you looked for and could not find in the latest frames. With "partial" coverage they may simply be out of frame.
- "actions": what changed DURING the episode, found by comparing the same spot in an earlier and a later frame: {"kind":"removed"|"added","item","count","confidence","actor"} with confidence 0..1. "actor" says whose hand did it: "wearer" when the arm or hand comes from the person holding this camera (it enters from the near edge of the frame, or the thing is lifted towards the camera), "other" when another person is seen doing it, "unknown" when no hand is visible. A thing that is there in an earlier frame and whose spot is visible but empty in a later frame was removed, whether or not a hand is visible; a thing in a hand counts too. Do not report a thing as removed just because the camera moved and its spot is out of frame.
- "layout": one entry per physical object, not per count. {"kind","slot","present"}.
  On a table, desk or counter, slot is "left", "center" or "right". In a fridge, cupboard or pantry, slot is "top", "middle", "bottom" or "door".
  present is true when that object is still there in the latest frame, false when it was there earlier in the episode and that spot is now empty.
  Two bottles side by side are two entries (left and right), never one entry. Do not invent pixel positions.
- "place": room type if obvious ("kitchen"), else null.
Item names: short, lowercase, singular ("milk", "egg carton", "coke can"). When a thing you see is the same as one in the known contents, reuse that exact spelling.
