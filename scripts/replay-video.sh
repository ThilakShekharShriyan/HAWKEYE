# Frames are sent at 4 per second; the last one is then held for hold-seconds
# (default 10) so the episode settles, as it would with a phone kept in place.
# Needs ffmpeg. Example, the two fixtures in order:

#   curl -s -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost:3000/api/ask \
#     -d '{"observerId":"01","text":"remember this location","image":"<a frame>"}'
#   scripts/replay-video.sh tests/fixtures/videos/02-recognise-and-take-snack.mov 02
